Algorithm Complexity:
-----------------------

    1. Time factor : Time is measured by counting the number of operations.
    2. Space factor :Space is measured by counting the maximum memory space required by the program.

Asymptotic Notations:
----------------------

  Asyptotic analysis of algorithm refers to defining the mathemaetical boundingof it's runtime performance.

Types od Asymptotic notations:
  
  1. Best case: minimum time required for program execution.
  2. Average case:average time required for program execution.
  3. Worst case:maximum time required for program execution.
